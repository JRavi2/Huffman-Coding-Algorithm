# Huffman Coding Algorithm for Text Compression

## Description

This is a mini project I recently worked on. It is a simple text compression program based on Huffman Coding Algorithm.
When ran, you are provided with 3 options:
1. Compress a file
2. Decompress a file
3. Compress and Decompress a file

The first and second choices show a more real world scenario where the code map is stored along with the compressed file.
The third choice just shows the maximum potential of the algorithm, by compressing and decompressing a file is succession while maintaing the code map in memory.

## How to run
```
gcc main.cpp -o main
./main
```
